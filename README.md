# _Galactic Age Calculator_

#### _This application can tell your relative age on other planets in our galaxy, 6.26.2020_

#### By _**Taylor Phillips**_

## Description

_This calculator can receive an age provided by the user and convert to an estimated age if you lived on another planet, with respect to that planet's solar years.  For instance, Earth has a solar year consisting of 365 days, and Mercury only has a solar year consisting of 88 days, therefore you would be much older if you had been living with respect to Mercury solar years._


### Technical Specs
| Spec | Input | Output |
| :-------------     | :------------- | :------------- |
| Method will receive an age and return the age in Earth years | 33  | 33 on Earth  |
| Method will receive an age and return the age in Mercury years  | 33  | 137 on Mercury |
| Method will receive an age and return the age in Venus years  | 33  | 53 on Venus |
| Method will receive an age and return the age in Mars years  | 33  | 17 on Mars |
| Method will recieve an age and return the age in Jupiter years  | 33  | 2 on Jupiter  |
|   |  |  |
| Method will receive an age and subtract from life expectancy (set at 80 years) to return estimated years remaining on Earth | 33  | You have 47 more Earth years remaining  |
| Method will receive an age and if older than life expectancy will return how many years over that life expectancy you've gone | 85  | You have exceeded by 5 Earth years  |
| Method will take user age and if it is equal to life expectancy then it will tell you that | 80 | "You are at life expectancy on Earth" |
|   |   |   |
| User inputted age (in Mercury Solar years) will be subtracted from life expectancy and remaining years in Mercury Solar time will be returned  | 33  | 196 Mercury years remaining  |
| User inputted age will be converted to mercury solar years and if you have exceeded life expectancy on that planet it will tell you by how many mercury solar years |  85  | You've exceeded by 21 Mercury years |
| If you User inputted age is at life expectancy, the output will reflect that  | 80 (333 Mercury Years) | "You're at life expectancy on Mercury" |
|   |   |   |
| User inputted age will be converted to Venus Solar years then subtracted from life expectancy to tell you how many Venus Solar years you have remaining until you reach life expectancy on that planet  | 33  |  76 years remaining in Venus Years |
| User age will be converted to Venus Solar time and if age is over life expectancy, it will tell you by how many venus years   |  85  |  You've exceeded by 8 Venus years  |
| If user age is at life expectancy, application will say so | 80 (129 Venus Years) | "You're at life expectancy on Venus"  |
|   |   |   |
| Converted Mars age will be subtracted from the life expectancy to tell you how many estimated Mars years you have remaining   | 33  |  25 years remaining in Mars Years |
| Converted Mars age will be subtracted from the life expectancy--If you have exceeded the life expectancy, it will tell you by home many years on that planet you've exceeded  |  85 |  You've exceeded by 2 Mars years  |
| If the converted Mars Age is equal to the life expectancy then it will return a message informing you of this |  80 |  You are at the life expectancy on Mars |
|   |     |     |
| Age will be converted to Jupiter age and then compared to life expectancy-- if it's less than it will tell you how many years you have remaining in Jupiter length years  | 33  |   |
